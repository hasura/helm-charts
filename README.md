# Hasura Helm Charts

This repository contains Helm charts to help with the deployment of Hasura GraphQL on Kubernetes. This project is currently in active development.

## Repository

The Charts are available in a Helm Chart Repository. [Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use these charts.
Please refer to the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to get started.

```bash
helm repo add hasura https://hasura.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

You can then see the charts by running:

```bash
helm search repo hasura
```

> You can change the repo name `hasura` to another one if getting conflicts.

For more information, have a look at the [Using Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-repo-working-with-repositories) documentation.
